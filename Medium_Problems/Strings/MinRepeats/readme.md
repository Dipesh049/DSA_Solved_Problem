- Logic to solve this question :-
- create another string 'S3' with length of given string B by repeating string A.
- start searching substring of 'S3' from i to j where (initially i=0 and j = length of string B )
- if the j reached end of the 'S3', again add string A to S3.
- if second string match with any of substring of 'S3' return no of repeatation of first string in 'S3'.
