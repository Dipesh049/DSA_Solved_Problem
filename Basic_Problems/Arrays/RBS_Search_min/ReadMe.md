# Minimum Number in a sorted rotated array

# Logic
- Here we have to return minimum number in rotated sorted array. So first of all we have to find the maximum element(Pivot) abd then return (pivot+1). Because if pivot is a max. elemenr then (pivot+1) is the smaller one.

EXAMPLE : 2, 3, 4, 15, 20, 1, 2
